1) pthread_create(&tid, &attr, runner, NULL); //creating a thread with default attributes. The program executes 1 thread.

2)
Line 16: pthread_t tid: declares at storage on the stack a thread named "tid". Creates an ide and a thread named "tid".  

Line 17: pthread_attr_t attr; declares "attr" to point to the threads attributes

Line 20: pthread_attr_init(&attr):This line initializes a thread attribute (attr). It will give default values for the attributes.

Line 25: pthread_create(&tid, &attr, runner, NULL); This line creates a new thread with the attributes from &attr which in this case is the default attributes. 
The thread created will be executing runner as a start routine with NULL arguments, the ID(name) of the thread is "tid".

Line 26: pthread_join(tid, NULL); This line will cancel the execution of thread "tid", exception if the target thread already is terminated. 
Null is that we dont care about any return value of the function.

3) NULL parameters are passed to the function runner. 
4) Global variable has a global scope and can be used within any function. 
5) join: the program can have problem running accordingly since the thread's execution might not have been finnished before the man thread is complete. 
When you use the join method in main it's gonna wait for the targeted thread to finnish before moving on.
